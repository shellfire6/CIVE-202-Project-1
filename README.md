# CIVE-202-Project-1
The Python code, raw data, and README for CIVE 202 Project 1

In this project, I collated and analyzed the air quality data provided by the client in order to find out multiple things:
1. The five sensor locations with the highest mean and median values of the three pollutants, VOC, PM2.5, and PM10.0
2. The days and locations at which the highest values of the three pollutants occurred
3. The effect of humidity and temperature on average concentration of each pollutant
4. The days and locations of any health risks based on air quality
I used python code to transform the data accurately, which has been provided and annotated. I then wrote out an analysis of the questions that were asked, determining relationships as necessary.
